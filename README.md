tracks stats of people you play with in party finder. lets you dodge them if you want, optionally with a length of time until they get another chance and note about them. has autokick and can say your note in chat before kicking if you want it to. can easily export and import dodgelist and player stats to share them with trusted people. the averages are actually medians of the last 30 runs because that works significantly better than average. doesn't use any hypixel api stuff, all stats tracked are personal. tracks the last class someone played in a run with you. tracks both realtime and tick time splits. tracks loot and stats about floor.
